# My Personal Website

This is my first `HTML`, *CSS*, and **JS** project. I will be using Git to manage versions of this project.

## Structure of an HTML page

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
      My Personal Website
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
  # Navod Wijesooriya
    ... Content goes here ...
  </body>
</html>
```
